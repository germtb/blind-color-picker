# blind-color-picker

This little project will help when you have a palette of colors and a color you picked from an image and you want to pick the color of the palette that is closest to the one you have on the image.

It might look like a weird situation, but it happens.

Imagine you have an app, which will probably have a palette of colors. If you later want to add a component you will most likely want to use the same palette. But the UX designer gave you a psd/png and you are like HOW DO I TELL BETWEEN THESE TEN SHADES OF GREY.

So, if you are basically blind to color tones, this might help you!

To use simply:

`node blind-color-picker.js '#FFEE00'`
